# Linear-regression
Cost and sigmoid functions I wrote after completing Progessor Ng's machine learning course on Coursera / Stanford online

The course walked the user through generating code for logistic regression, so here I've adapted the result to perform the similar task of linear regression

Loads data from a .xls file and returns the y intercept and x coefficients according to the required dimensions

Dependent on a gradient descent algorithm called fminunc

I have tested this against a similar function in R using data from intensive care, and happily it produced an identical result!

Note that although Github recognises the code as Matlab, it was actually written in a sister language called Octave, which is open-source, so there may be compatibility issues if used in Matlab
