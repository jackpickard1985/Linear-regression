# Linear-regression
Cost and sigmoid functions I wrote after completing Progessor Ng's machine learning course on Coursera / Stanford online

Loads data from a .xls file and returns the y intercept and x coefficients according to the required dimensions

Dependent on a gradient descent algorithm called fminunc

I have tested this against a similar function in R using data from intensive care, and happily it produced an identical result!
